# Documentation Roadmap

This document outlines a proposed roadmap and an ongoing development plan for our Stride Docs website.

- **Address Existing Issues**: Prioritize resolving issues listed in the [Issues](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-docs/issues) section on GitHub.
- **Image Optimization**: Convert existing images to the WebP format to enhance website performance.
- **Content Enhancement**: Implement improvements across all sections of the documentation to ensure clarity, accuracy, and comprehensiveness.
- **Guidance for Contributors**: Provide clear instructions for contributors on writing XML comments in C#, which play a crucial role in enhancing the API documentation.
