You can have Stride play only certain portions of an audio asset. This means, for example, that you can create multiple samples from a single audio asset by specifying different ranges in different [SoundInstance](xref:Stride.Audio.SoundInstance) objects.

You can use the following properties, methods, and structures:

| Property, method, or structure                                                                        | Function                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [TotalLength](xref:Stride.Audio.SoundBase.TotalLength)                                                | The total length of the [sound](xref:Stride.Audio.Sound).          |
| [SoundInstance.SetRange(PlayRange)](xref:Stride.Audio.SoundInstance.SetRange(Stride.Media.PlayRange)) | Sets the time range to play within the audio asset.                |
| [PlayRange](xref:Stride.Media.PlayRange)                                                              | Time information, including the range's starting point and length. |
| [SoundInstance.Position](xref:Stride.Audio.SoundInstance.Position)                                    | Gets the current play position as **TimeSpan**.                    |

For example:

```cs
//Assume sample length is 4 seconds.
var length = mySound.TotalLength;
var begin = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2);
var duration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2);
mySoundInstance.SetRange(new PlayRange(begin, duration));
```
