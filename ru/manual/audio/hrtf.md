# Head-related transfer function (HRTF) audio

**Head-related transfer function (HRTF)** is an advanced way of rendering audio so that sounds appear to come from a specific point in 3D space, synthesizing binaural audio. It provides more realistic audio than standard [spatialized audio](spatialized-audio.md). For example, with HRTF, the player can hear whether a character is above or below them. This is particularly useful for [VR applications](../virtual-reality/index.md), as it increases immersion.

Players don't need special hardware to use HRTF. However, the effect works much better with headphones than speakers.

This video demonstrates the effect of HRTF audio:

>For now, you can only use HRTF on Windows 10.

## Enable HRTF

To use HRTF, first enable it globally in the **Game Settings** asset, then enable HRTF on the entities you want to use it with.

### 1. Enable HRTF globally

1. In **Solution explorer** (the bottom-left pane by default), select the **Assets folder**.

    ![Select Assets folder asset](../game-studio/media/select-asset-folder.png)

2. In the **Asset View** (the bottom pane by default), select the **GameSettings** asset.

3. In the **Property Grid** (the right-hand pane by default), under **Audio settings**, select **HRTF support**.

For more information about the Game Settings asset, see [Game settings](../game-studio/game-settings.md).

### 2. Enable HRTF on the entities

1. Select the entity with the [audio emitter](audio-emitters.md) that contains the sound you want to enable for HRTF.

2. In the **Property Grid** (on the right by default), under **Audio emitter**, select **Use HRTF**.

    Sounds emitted from this entity will use HRTF.

    >[!Note]
    >The HRTF option applies to every sound emitted from this audio emitter.
    
For more information about audio emitters, including the properties you can change, see [Audio emitters](audio-emitters.md).
