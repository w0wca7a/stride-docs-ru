# Sprites

2D applications are made of **sprites**.

The most efficient way to render sprites is to add them all to a **sprite sheet**, a single image. You can then define regions of the sprite sheet as different sprites in Game Studio's Sprite Editor. After you define sprites, you can add them to entities using sprite components and render them with scripts.
