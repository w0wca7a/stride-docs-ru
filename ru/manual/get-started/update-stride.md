> The instructions provided here can be used as a general guide for updating to any new version of Stride.

## Updating Stride

1. **Update Visual Studio 2022:** Ensure that you have the latest version of Visual Studio 2022. This is crucial for compatibility with the latest Stride version. After updating Visual Studio, restart your computer to apply the changes fully.
1. **Stride Launcher Instructions:** Open the Stride Launcher. Follow the instructions provided to update or install the Visual Studio plugin for Stride. This step is essential for integrating the latest version of Stride with your development environment.
1. **Restart Again:** After completing the installation or update of the Visual Studio plugin, restart your computer once more. This helps to ensure that all components are correctly loaded and ready for use.

## Updating Your Project

1. **Version Control:** Before proceeding with the update, confirm that your project is under version control with all current changes committed. This provides a safety net, allowing you to revert to the previous state if needed. If you're not using version control, ensure you have a backup of your project.
1. **Opening the Project:** When you open a project created with an older version of Stride, a dialogue will appear, prompting you to update the project. Make sure to check the option to apply the update to all packages in the solution. Additionally, you can verify later whether all packages have been updated by checking your project files, specifically the `.csproj` files.
