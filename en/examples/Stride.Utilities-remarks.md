This remark serves as a demonstration of how to use overwrite files in API documentation. Overwrite files allow us to add a remarks section to the API docs seamlessly.

> [!NOTE]
> This text is an example of how to incorporate notes within the documentation. Notes are useful for providing additional information about the subject. You can also use ticks ` for code snippets.

> [!CAUTION]
> This text is an example of how to incorporate caution notes within the documentation to highlight important information or warnings.

<p style="color:green">Html support is also available in the remarks section.</p>
