<p><strong>Initializers</strong> control the states of particles such as position, velocity, size, and so on when the particles are first spawned. They have no effect on particles spawned on previous frames.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
</div>
<p>Some <a href="updaters.html">updaters</a> act change the particle's value at the <em>end</em> of the frame. They effectively overwrite any initial values set by a similar initializer. Such is the case with all animations. They operate on the particle's lifetime and a color animation updater will overwrite any initial values from a color initializer.</p>
<p>Similarly, initializers which operate on the same field are exclusive and only the bottom one will have any effect, since they are executed in order. For example if you assign two color initializer, only the second one will have any effect.]</p>
<h2 id="common-properties">Common properties</h2>
<p>Several properties are common across many initializers.</p>

<p>For example, a velocity initializer can change its direction depending on the parent's rotation or decide to ignore it and always shoot particles in a fixed direction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, size initializers don't change based on the parent's rotation, so the rotation fields won't appear at all.</p>
<h2 id="position">Position</h2>
<p>Particles are spawned in an axis-aligned bounding box, defined by its left lower back corner and its right upper front corner.</p>

<h2 id="velocity">Velocity</h2>
<p>Particles spawn with initial velocity which ranges between the defined values. The velocity is independent in all three directions between X, Y and Z.</p>

<h2 id="size">Size</h2>

<h2 id="3d-orientation">3D Orientation</h2>
<p>Initial 3D orientation sets the orientation for 3D-aware particles when they first spawn. The editable fields use euclidean rotation which is packed into a quaternion orientation by the engine. The interpolated value is on the shortest path  between the two orientations, rather than interpolating each value separately.</p>

<h2 id="spawn-order">Spawn Order</h2>
<p>This initializer has no properties. It simply sets an increasing number to each particle spawned from this emitter, starting from 0. The spawn order can be used for sorting or some custom calculations.</p>
<h2 id="position-arc">Position (Arc)</h2>
<p>The arc position initializer positions the particles in an arc (or a straight line if the arc's height is 0) between two point, the emitter's position and a target transform component. With random position offset you can cause the particles to deviate a little from their original location on the arc.</p>
