<h1 id="xenko-16-release-notes">Xenko 1.6 release notes</h1>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<h3 id="prefabs">Prefabs</h3>
<p>Prefabs allow you to assemble entities into building blocks and easily reuse them in any of your scenes. Changes to your prefabs will be reflected on all instances (as long as properties are not overridden).</p>
<p>We even took the concept one step further to empower our users, by having prefabs within prefabs, as well as the possibility to use only part of a prefab when you instantiate it. And of course, removing or rearranging a few entities won't break your prefab synchronization!</p>
<img src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.6/prefabs.gif" align="center">
<h3 id="archetypes">Archetypes</h3>
<p>You can now use any asset as an archetype for another asset. When you change a property of the archetype, the new value will be automatically propagated to all the derived assets, unless you specifically override them. Archetypes can be used with most asset types.</p>
<img src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.6/assset-templating.gif" align="center">
<h3 id="particles">Particles</h3>
<p>You can now create and edit particle systems directly in the Xenko Game Studio. Particles are deeply integrated in the game engine and leverage the powerful effect system and its high level of customization.</p>
<p>While there are still several features on the roadmap, the current implementation is sufficient for most games. The ability to customize almost all aspects of the particle engine allows you to add features tailored to your game's specific needs.</p>
<img src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.6/particle1.gif" align="center">
<p>Feel free to visit our <a href="../manual/particles/index.html">particle documentation</a>.</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<p>The particle engine supports many features out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Render particles as different shapes like billboards, 3D oriented quads or your own custom implementation</li>
<li>Powerful force fields which offer more control than simple attractors and repulsors</li>
<li>Collisions</li>
<li>Animated attributes such as size, color, rotation</li>
<li>Flip books, UV animation and support for the Xenko Shading Language</li>
<li>Ribbons and trails renderers added to the engine. Check out our <a href="../manual/particles/ribbons-and-trails.html">tutorial</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="modular-system">Modular system</h4>
<p>All aspects of particle systems are broken down into individuals modules like spawners, initializers and updaters, and each of these modules is easily tweakable and customizable. Check out the samples and the Xenko documentation for a detailed walk-through.</p>
<h4 id="curve-editor">Curve Editor</h4>
<p>The Game Studio now also comes with a built-in curve editor. For now only the particle engine uses curve animation. In the future, it will also power our property animation system and our storyboard system.</p>
<img src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.6/particle2.gif" align="center">
<h3 id="new-graphics-engine">New Graphics Engine</h3>
<p>Most of our graphics pipeline, both low-, medium- and high-level, has been almost completely rewritten, and should be ready for the future.</p>
<p>The low-level API has been changed to more closely resemble DirectX 12 and Vulkan. For a list of breaking changes, please see below.</p>
<p>The high-level pipeline has been completely reworked, to achieve the following goals, most of which we will tackle in the upcoming releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a clean and extensible architecture to easily build new graphics features on (hoping to soon add a Forward+ renderer, IBL light probes, RLR, etc.)</li>
<li>New medium-level layer: lightweight RenderFeature, RenderStage, RenderObject, etc.</li>
<li>Easy for users to write small customizations (by implementing RenderFeatures)</li>
<li>Allow multi-threading of all parts of the pipeline</li>
<li>Make optimal use of next-gen graphics APIs</li>
<li>Reduce the amount of &quot;magic&quot; done by the effect system to increase performance</li>
<li>Minimize work by taking better advantage of different update frequencies (PerView, PerMaterial, PerLighting, etc.)</li>
<li>Take advantage of new API (first class support for Pipeline State Objects, Descriptor Sets, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for technical details and performance evaluation in the near future!</p>
<h3 id="direct3d-12">Direct3D 12</h3>
<p>Direct3D 12 has been added as a new build target. While still experimental, it already supports all parts of our rendering pipeline.</p>
<p>You can try it by changing the ‘Preferred Graphics Platform’ in the ‘Rendering Settings’ of your ‘Game Settings’ asset.</p>
<h3 id="better-opengl-support">Better OpenGL support</h3>
<p>Our OpenGL renderer has been improved and should behave much better (shadows, PBR, etc.). Also, we now deliver OpenGL and OpenGL ES on Windows as build targets.</p>
<p>You can also try them by changing the ‘Preferred Graphics Platform’ in the ‘Rendering Settings’ of your ‘Game Settings’ asset.</p>
<h3 id="scripts-are-now-components">Scripts are now components</h3>
<p>So far, there could only be one component per type on an Entity. This was quite cumbersome, especially for scripts, which had to be stored inside the <code>ScriptComponent.Scripts</code> list. It also resulted in many special cases to make them work in the editor (i.e. references between scripts, assembly reloading, etc.).</p>
<p>Now multiple components of a type are allowed. This affects scripts and physics components, and can be used for custom components for which more than one instance is sensible.</p>
<p>We hope this makes your life easier!</p>
<h3 id="event-system">Event system</h3>
<p>We added a simple event system that will allow your script to easily communicate with each other.
Check out the <code>EventKey&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>EventReceiver&lt;&gt;</code> classes.
You can create an EventKey from your sender scripts and consume events using <code>EventReceiver</code> from other scripts.</p>
<h3 id="game-settings-overrides">Game Settings overrides</h3>
<p>The Game Settings asset has been improved: You can now have different settings depending on the platform or GPU.</p>
<p>For example, you might want to set different off-screen resolutions for your game on Android depending on the GPU model. Or you could use one of our new Direct3D12, OpenGL or OpenGL ES renderers on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="version-167-beta">Version 1.6.7-beta</h2>
<p>Release date: 2016/06/09</p>
<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
<h4 id="game-studio">Game Studio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don't wait for editor initialization before showing the editor window. This should prevent editor layouts from suddendly switching without notice, especially when opening a big scene.</li>
<li>Save the list of opened editors more often (everytime a new editor is opened). Before it was only saved when editing the Game Studio properly and thus the list would not be saved when a crash occurred.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issues-fixed">Issues fixed</h3>
<h4 id="graphics">Graphics</h4>
<ul>
<li>D3D12: Static sampler didn't properly set comparison func and border, resulting in broken shadow maps</li>
<li>OpenGL ES: Improved texture format supports depending on OpenGL ES version and extension presents (esp. for float texture on ES2)</li>
<li>OpenGL ES: EXT_sRGB doesn't seem to properly work on Adreno 4xx, but since it is usually available through ES3 context, we use that first when available</li>
<li>OpenGL: AMD GPU driver didn't like the fact there was no #version in the Copy GLSL shader</li>
<li>OpenGL: Even though we use SDL, image loading now uses same code as WinForms/WPF (since SDL_image loading code is not implemented yet)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="assets">Assets</h4>
<ul>
<li>AssetCompiler was caching assemblies so that they could be modified while running. This feature is only useful in development and was making thing both slower and causing too long path issues, it has therefore been disabled for end-user install (<a href="https://github.com/SiliconStudio/xenko/issues/410">#410</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="engine">Engine</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added missing XenkoDefaultFont root asset in default package, this makes the profiler system work again out of the box.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="game-studio-1">Game Studio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix a crash that could occurs when loading a project that contains broken paths to resource files</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="issues-fixed-1">Issues fixed</h3>
<h4 id="game-studio-3">Game Studio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue preventing to save editor layout when the history of projects reach the maximum size (currently 20 projects).</li>
<li>Material Selection mode (which allows you to pick a material by clicking directly on the mesh area) was broken.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="engine-1">Engine</h4>
<ul>
<li>Changed how OpenGL ES expected vs actual version is handled; this should fix various issues related to context creation on Android and also code targeting older OpenGL should be more consistent across devices.</li>
<li>There was some issues for GPU resource disposal that might have lead to incorrect state (might fix some issues when closing scenes in the editor).</li>
<li>ShadowMaps across multiple RenderViews were not working properly (same shadow map texture can be reused but in fact was not).</li>
<li>Improved the engine's behavior when mobile apps require to handle multiple orientations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="particles-2">Particles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where non-uniform scaling and rotation on the entities resulted in wrong rotation of the particle system. Currently only uniform scaling is supported.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="issues-fixed-2">Issues fixed</h3>
<h4 id="engine-2">Engine</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix negative index parameter of SpriteFromSheet.GetSprite throwing an exception. Negative index now circles around the collection of sprites (e.g. -1 return the last sprite).</li>
<li>If a background component was enabled and then disabled, it would still render.</li>
<li>MSAA rasterizer state was enabled even when not needed (with level 0 so it didn't affect much, except subtle differences in tessellation tests).</li>
<li>Removed a ThrowNotImplementedException in OnSoundControllerListChanged, re-implemented the missing part.</li>
<li>Made non generic EventKey and EventReceiver consume bool instead of byte</li>

<li>Properly separated rendering in 4 phases: Collect (collect &amp; cull), Extract (copy data from scene to renderers), Prepare (prepare cbuffer data &amp; heavy computations), Draw (emit draw calls)</li>
<li>Introduced concepts of RenderFeature (entry point for extending rendering), RenderStage (effect selection), RenderView and RenderObject</li>
<li>Render sorting logic can now be customized (culling will be soon too)</li>
<li>Low-level API has been rewritten to match better new API: CommandList, DescriptorSet, DescriptorHeap, PipelineState, etc.</li>
<li>Introduced concept of RendererProcessor which are responsible for pushing component data to rendering</li>
<li>Many other changes, that will soon be covered in documentation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="input">Input</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved GamePad event management to resemble the keyboard API.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issues-fixed-7">Issues fixed</h3>
<h4 id="game-studio-12">Game Studio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix Scripts thumbnail generation during project launch.</li>
<li>Fix Settings window sharing columns layout with property grid (<a href="https://github.com/SiliconStudio/xenko/issues/341">#341</a>).</li>
<li>Fix default IDE settings incorrectly reset to null.</li>
<li>Fix a crash occurring when duplicating an object quickly after selecting it.</li>
<li>Fix an issue with the message box incorrectly resizing.</li>
<li>Tooltips are always visible even if the control (menu, button…) is disabled.</li>
<li>Fix several issues with undo/redo.</li>
<li>Fix drag and drop of components into properties</li>
<li>Sometimes the Game Studio was not asking to save when closed with some changes in a project.</li>
<li>Fix some issues related to folders in scene editor.</li>
<li>Redo does not re-open asset picker anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="graphics-4">Graphics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tangents generation was invalid and might have resulted in various swaps</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="physics-2">Physics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved collision detection reliability</li>
<li>Fixed collision filter groups</li>
<li>Fixed enable/disable component behavior</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h3>
<h4 id="graphics-5">Graphics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extending rendering is quite different from before. Please check SpaceEscape and other samples to have a better idea while we prepare documentation.</li>
<li>Many methods of GraphicsDevice have been split off into a second class: CommandList</li>
<li>Added objects such as PipelineState, DescriptorSet and DescriptorHeap to better match new graphics API</li>
<li>Game now contains a GraphicsContext which gives access to the current CommandList</li>
<li>GraphicsDevice.BackBuffer and GraphicsDevice.DepthStencilBuffer are gone. Use GraphicsDevice.Presenter.BackBuffer to access the actual backbuffer.</li>
<li>In addition to RenderContext, there is now a RenderDrawContext. Some methods have been changed to expect the latter.</li>
<li>ParameterCollection has been rewritten to be much more memory and performance efficient (data is now stored directly in buffers).</li>
<li>Transferring values from application to shaders and computation of effect permutations used to be done through various inefficient ParameterCollection overrides. This should now be done using RenderFeatures.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="physics-3">Physics</h4>
<ul>
<li>PhysicsComponents are now split into 3 different types (Rigidbody, Character, StaticCollider) which can be added multiple times in an entity.</li>
<li>PhysicsElements are now removed, including the Collider, Rigidbody and Character classes. They now are merged into the new components.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes duplicate contacts are detected by the physics engine</li>
</ul>
