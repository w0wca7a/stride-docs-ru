<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<h3 id="scene-hierarchy-and-scene-streaming">Scene hierarchy and scene streaming</h3>
<p>Working with scenes has become more flexible. Instead of a single scene, your game can now use a hierarchy of scenes to organize entities into levels, areas or layers, and let teams collaborate on them more efficiently.</p>
<p>Game Studio displays child scenes together with their parent. Individual scenes can be loaded, unload, locked and moved around.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/scene_editor_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/scene_editor_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>When running your game, the <strong>default scene</strong> set in your <strong>game settings</strong> is loaded as the <strong>root scene</strong> and can be used to store persistent entities. More scenes can be dynamically loaded and unloaded from scripts and added as <strong>child scenes</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">var childScene = Content.Load&lt;Scene&gt;(&quot;myChildScene&quot;);
SceneSystem.SceneInstance.RootScene.Children.Add(childScene);
</code></pre>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/scene_streaming_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/scene_streaming_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>To get started, take a look at the new built-in <code>SceneStreamingScript</code>. It demonstrates background scene loading when passing through trigger volumes.</p>
<p>You can now use a scene's <code>Offset</code> to move its entities both at design time and runtime.</p>
<p>The <code>ChildSceneComponent</code> has been removed. We encourage all entities to be managed by a single <strong>entity manager</strong> and rendered by a single <strong>graphics compositor</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-reality">Virtual reality</h3>
<p>Enabling VR is now as simple as a single click!</p>
<p>Xenko's clustered forward rendering, with its multisample anti-aliasing, makes it ideal for VR. Xenko uses a single API for every device, with native support for Oculus and HTV Vive (more devices coming very soon).</p>
<p>Xenko comes with a VR game sample that shows you how to implement VR gameplay, including environment interaction and teleportation:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/vr_template_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/vr_template_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Save valuable time by visualizing and testing VR directly from the scene editor:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/vr_editor_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/vr_editor_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3 id="global-illumination-with-light-probes">Global illumination with light probes</h3>
<p>Light probes capture the lighting at the position you place them. They simulate indirect light, the effect of light bouncing off surfaces and illuminating other surfaces.</p>
<p>They can make a dramatic difference to the mood and appearance of your scene.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/light_probes_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/light_probes_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Light probes can be <strong>placed freely</strong> and are processed <strong>per pixel</strong>. This means you can use them not only on small dynamic objects, but also large or static objects (until we have light maps for those!).</p>
<p>Last but not least, you can now very easily capture a DDS cubemap from current camera position in editor, for use as a diffuse or specular skybox light.</p>
<h3 id="light-shafts">Light shafts</h3>
<p>Xenko now supports shadow map-based light shafts for directional lights.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/lightshaft_CoS_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/lightshaft_CoS_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Our implementation uses ray-marching rather than post effects, making the shaft visible and cool-looking even if the light source isn't visible.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/lightshaft_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/lightshaft_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3 id="graphics-compositor">Graphics compositor</h3>
<p>The graphics compositor is now a separate asset.</p>
<p>Rendering parameters (such as VR) and post effect parameters can be tweaked in just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/graphics_compositor.jpg" alt="Graphics compositor"></p>
<p>This is just the first step towards making the graphics compositor easy to customize and extend. Stay tuned for more changes in future releases!</p>
<h3 id="improved-visual-studio-experience">Improved Visual Studio experience</h3>
<p>We now have full support for <strong>Visual Studio 2017</strong>!</p>
<ul>
<li>Xenko Visual Studio extension now supports Visual Studio 2017</li>
<li>Game Studio recognizes Visual Studio 2017</li>
<li>Games can use C# 7.0, and our script editor can recognize C# 7.0 and offer C# 7.0 refactoring thanks to Roslyn (you need to make your solution VS2017+ for it to work)</li>
<li>Our internal <code>AssemblyProcessor</code> which perform various operations on generated assemblies can now work with portable PDB (as generated by .NET Standard projects)</li>
</ul>
<p>Programmers working with Xenko often go back and forth between Game Studio and Visual Studio. To make their lives easier, we made a few key improvements to the Xenko Visual Studio extension:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now open the current solution in Game Studio directly from Visual Studio.</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting didn't behave well when switching theme.</li>
<li>Previously, when assets are compiling, MSBuild didn't report any progress until finished. It now displays information, warnings and errors while it compiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, our whole build infrastructure and script editor is now based on the latest version of MSBuild 2017 and Roslyn. Supporting the new VS2017 Project System with .NET Standard is just a few steps away!</p>
<h3 id="faster-and-lighter">Faster and lighter</h3>
<p>In order to provide a better experience for users, we've been working hard on various fronts to make the editor smoother and more responsive. This is still a work in progress and expect regular improvements.</p>
<p>Also, the package size is almost three times smaller, resulting in much faster download and install time.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>
<h3 id="backward-compatibility">Backward compatibility</h3>
<p>Xenko 2.0 supports project upgrades only for projects created with Xenko 1.10 Beta. If you want to upgrade a project made with an older version, update it to Xenko 1.10 first.</p>
<h3 id="visual-studio-support">Visual Studio support</h3>
<p>Xenko 2.0 supports Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017 as IDEs. Visual Studio 2013 and earlier versions are no longer supported.</p>
<p>When upgrading a project from earlier version, in its <code>.csproj</code> file, set <code>ToolsVersion=&quot;14.0&quot;</code> as the minimum required version.</p>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>All compontents related to navigation have been moved to their own <code>SiliconStudio.Xenko.Navigation</code> assembly and namespace.</p>
<h3 id="graphics-compositor-1">Graphics Compositor</h3>
<p>Previously, rendering pipeline was customized by magic <code>IPipelinePlugin</code> at runtime. This was very hard to control. Now, most of the pipeline configuration happens  at design time in the new Graphics Compositor asset.</p>
<p><code>RenderFrame</code> is gone. Renderer are typically declaring and allocating render targets.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, when switching the underlying Graphics Platform, rendering doesn't occur or fail. To fix the problem, delete the cache, local, and roaming folders on the Linux host and restart the game.</li>
<li>Performance issues on mobile (being worked on)</li>
<li>On iOS, if <code>Enable device-specific builds</code> is toggled on (from the project properties), it's not possible to debug game code. To speed up your development manually select the architecture of your device from the Advanced tab.</li>
<li>Live scripting has been temporarily disabled</li>
</ul>
