<h1 id="xenko-19-beta-release-notes">Xenko 1.9 beta release notes</h1>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<p>Xenko 1.9 Beta introduces several major new features along with several relevant enhancements to existing features.</p>
<p>We are excited to offer three new game templates to speed up your game design time, a brand new script editor as well as expanded copy-paste functionality.</p>
<p>The last major new feature is our new Navigation Mesh system.</p>
<h3 id="game-templates">Game Templates</h3>
<p>We have added several templates packed with a lot of functionality to help you kickstart your games. Choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Person Shooter</li>
<li>Third Person Platformer</li>
<li>Top-View RPG</li>
</ul>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/game_templates.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/game_templates.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>All of them come with basic camera and player functionality found in most games of their respective genres. They also have many production-quality assets so you can easily try different features on your own.</p>
<p>In addition to the game templates, the <strong>New Game</strong> project now includes optional packages with all the assets we used to build the samples. Unlike the game templates which are trimmed down, the optional packages include ALL assets, including some which are not used by any Xenko sample.</p>
<h3 id="script-editor">Script Editor</h3>
<p>To ease friction from switching back and forth between the Game Studio and your IDE, we’ve built a new Script Editor.  Relying fully on Visual Studio is no longer necessary because you can now edit your code directly within the Game Studio itself. You’ll get full syntax highlighting, auto-completion, live diagnostics and even the ability to auto-reload C# files and projects that changed on your hard drive due to changes in your external editor (e.g., Visual Studio).</p>
<p>In fact, expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight, auto-completion and live diagnostics is available in the Xenko API, your own game code and libraries that you use</li>
<li>Auto-reload C# scripts and C# project changes that happened in the background</li>
<li>A Visual Studio like experience for all your code editing!</li>
</ul>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/script_editor/code_completion.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/script_editor/code_completion.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>We had some help from Microsoft’s .NET compiler, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Roslyn</a>, so Xenko users will also receive the full benefit of all the latest features of .NET. Adding a Rosyln-based Script Editor makes it easier to keep up with the latest C# updates.</p>
<p>Using the Xenko Script Editor is fairly straightforward. Just follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project/game in Game Studio</li>
<li>Add a script in Game Studio</li>
<li>Edit the script in Game Studio</li>
</ul>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/script_editor/create_script_gamestudio.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/script_editor/create_script_gamestudio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>C# scripts saved on Visual Studio side (or any text editor, for that matter) will automatically be updated in Game Studio without reloading. Same goes for project changes (.csproj): new scripts will appear automatically upon saving. GameStudio will automatically listen for file changes on the hard drive and update them live, or ask you what to do in case of conflicts.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/script_editor/external_changes.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/script_editor/external_changes.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Under the hood, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Rosyln</a> is the underlying technology that can process your Xenko source code. But we didn’t stop there! We were fortunate to find <a href="http://avalonedit.net/">AvalonEdit</a>, which provided us what we wanted for the visual appearance of the UI aspect of the Xenko script editor. We also integrated <a href="https://roslynpad.net/">RoslynPad</a>, which connects Roslyn and AvalonEdit together.</p>
<h3 id="navigation-meshes">Navigation Meshes</h3>
<p>In Xenko 1.9β, you can create a <strong>navigation mesh</strong> powered by <a href="https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation">Recast and Detour</a> with <strong>real-time feedback</strong> directly in the <strong>Xenko GameStudio!</strong> The navigation mesh is especially useful for RPGs or top-down strategy games, as you can use it to <strong>guide characters through complex scenes</strong>. The real-time feedback makes it easy to adjust and conveniently customize AI movement and the dimensions of the navigation mesh itself. The green outline of Xenko’s Navigation Mesh shows where the AI comes into play and where the colliders are set.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/navmeshes/withOutlineAE.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/navmeshes/withOutlineAE.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>In the videos, you can see how the AI navigates the level using the logic within the navigation mesh, and how the colliders will automatically be set in real-time. Of course, you can script AI movement manually, too.</p>

   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/navmeshes/NoOutlineAE.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3 id="copy--paste-functionality-expanded">Copy &amp; Paste Functionality Expanded</h3>
<p>In the past we only supported copy and pasting of assets, but now you can <strong>copy-paste pretty much anything</strong> in the Game Studio.</p>
<p>Any entities in a scene are now copyable, as well as any sprites of a sprite sheet, UI elements, or even a single property in the property grid! For instance, you can copy a list and perform any of the following operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insert it into another list at various positions, for example:</li>
</ul>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/Copy_InsertIntoList.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/Copy_InsertIntoList.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<ul>
<li>Copy and insert into the list (by pasting at a list item level).*</li>
</ul>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/Copy_AppendToList.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/Copy_AppendToList.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<ul>
<li>Copy and append to a list, for example, append it to the end of the list.</li>
</ul>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/Copy_ReplaceList.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/Copy_ReplaceList.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<ul>
<li>Copy and replace the whole list.</li>
</ul>
<p>A bit more difficult to explain, but perhaps easier to show than write about is <strong>copy and replace at an item level</strong>. This action (shown in the video below) will remove the item (at its position in the list) and insert the copied ones starting at the same position of the item in the list. In our example below, the copy replace starts from Item 2 in List 2:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/Copy_ReplaceIntoList.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/Copy_ReplaceIntoList.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Some information about copying entities and prefabs:</p>
<p><strong>An entire hierarchy of entities can be copied from one scene or prefab to another scene or prefab</strong>. Prefab instance will keep their reference to the source prefab as illustrated in the following example:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/CopyPaste_BetweenScenes2.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/CopyPaste_BetweenScenes2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p><em>The prefab “MyHero” is copied into the scene. Links to the prefab are maintained.</em></p>
<p>It is also possible to <strong>copy a component from an entity and paste it into another entity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Any absolutely any property that can be serialized can be copied</strong>. You can copy something from one scene to another scene, from a sub-element in one scene to another scene and even from a scene to a text file, back and forth as needed. You can also copy simple values in the property grid (e.g., primitives such as int, vector3, string…) between separate Game Studio instances if that is something you find practical and useful.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of copying between scripts and transform entities in the GameStudio Property Grid:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-1.9/copy_paste/CopyPaste_PropertyGrid.jpg">

</video>
<h3 id="net-standard">.NET Standard</h3>
<p>Starting with Xenko 1.9, shared Game assemblies will be created using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library">.NET Standard</a> rather than PCL.</p>
<p>It offers <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/">many advantages</a>: much better API surface for the developer, improved forward and backward compatibility, reduced fragmentation, finer-grained modularity of the framework, easier to write cross-platform apps, more frequent updates, etc.</p>
<p>Newly created applications will target .NET Standard 1.4, but users are of course free to target a different version. Also, your existing PCL projects will still work as is, but we recommend you to update your projects to .NET Standard!</p>
<h3 id="assembly-reloading">Assembly Reloading</h3>
<p>Iterating on code is very important. So far, Xenko was supporting changes in scripts: as soon as you saved any C# file, Game Studio was offering to recompile and reload the assembly with the updated scripts. If there is an error loading the type, you can still edit other part of the asset, save it back while preserving the parts that could not be loaded.</p>
<p>In this version, we generalized the approach so that any type embedded in your assets can be reloaded! As a result, you can now implement your own classes for anything you want directly in your game or plugin assemblies, and keep editing them without restarting the Game Studio.</p>
<p>This includes renderers, material features, and will soon be extensively used in new assets.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>
<h3 id="windows-phone-and-windows-store-removed">Windows Phone and Windows Store Removed</h3>
<p>Windows Phone and Windows Store platforms are both removed.
Please use the newer <code>Universal Windows Apps (UWP)</code> instead. This platform was previously known as <code>Windows 10</code>.
Projects will be automatically upgraded to reflect this change.</p>
<p>Also, we renamed preprocessor definition <code>SILICONSTUDIO_PLATFORM_WINDOWS_RUNTIME</code> into <code>SILICONSTUDIO_PLATFORM_UWP</code>.</p>
<h3 id="net-standard-1">.NET Standard</h3>
<p>The switch to .NET Standard for newly created projects implies that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runtime .NET framework requirement when distributing your projects is bumped from .NET 4.5 to .NET 4.6.1.</li>
<li>You need Visual Studio 2015 to open and compile newly created projects</li>
<li>You can upgrade older projects to use .NET Standard using Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 (in project properties)</li>
<li>From version 1.9, we don't install prerequisites to compile PCL projects anymore. If you have somebody in your team still working on a project created with a previous version of Xenko on a fresh PC, please make them install Xenko 1.8 so that it installs the proper prerequisites (even if the project has been updated to a newer version of Xenko).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asset-serialization">Asset Serialization</h3>
<p>We changed how we serialize asset in YAML. We introduced new concepts that improve how we can track overrides between an archetype or a prefab and assets/entities inheriting from it. Although everything happens &quot;under the hood&quot;, this is a actually a heavy change that might impact the upgrading of your project.</p>
<p>We removed asset upgrading for projects made with version 1.3 and below (released more than a year ago). It is possible that you experience some issues when upgrading a project made with versions 1.4 to 1.7, but you should properly be able to upgrade any project that uses version 1.8. However a few cases are not supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency Properties of UI elements that are overridden from an UI library will be reset during upgrade. Therefore, properties such as Grid Column and Row will have to be manually restored.</li>
<li>Some case of overriden materials in the material list of ModelComponent might be improperly upgraded.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dropping-support-for-windows-store-81-and-windows-phone-81">Dropping Support for Windows Store 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1</h3>
<p>To properly support the .NET Standard 1.4 and offer our developers a more up-to-date and robust API, we decided to drop support for Windows Store 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 platforms.</p>
<p>As Microsoft seems to be focusing on Universal Windows Platform (UWP), we’ve also decided it was best to refocus on more pertinent and relevant platforms for Xenko users. UWP was introduced with Windows 10, and a whole range of devices already support it.</p>
<p>Of course, you are free to stick with Xenko 1.8 in case you have a project targeting one of those two platforms -- we know this is a big change, and we will make every effort to help our developers with this transition. We apologize for the inconvenience, and aim to bring you a top-notch .NET user experience!</p>
<p>Just as a reminder, we already support Universal Windows Platform (UWP) on x86, x64 and ARM as of Xenko 1.8, which means games and apps developed with Xenko can be deployed on a whole range of Microsoft devices, including <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/index">Xbox One</a>. Until 1.9, this platform was named Windows10 in Xenko, but we took the liberty to rename it UWP to better match the official naming.</p>
